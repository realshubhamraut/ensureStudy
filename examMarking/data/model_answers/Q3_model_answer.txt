CPU scheduling algorithms determine which process gets the CPU at any given time.

First Come First Serve (FCFS): This is the simplest scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. It is non-preemptive, meaning once a process starts execution, it runs to completion. FCFS can suffer from the convoy effect where short processes wait for long processes to complete, leading to poor average waiting time.

Shortest Job First (SJF): This algorithm selects the process with the smallest burst time for execution next. SJF can be preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First) or non-preemptive. It minimizes average waiting time and is theoretically optimal. However, it requires knowing burst times in advance and can cause starvation for longer processes.

Round Robin (RR): This is a preemptive algorithm designed for time-sharing systems. Each process gets a small unit of CPU time called a time quantum or time slice (typically 10-100ms). After the quantum expires, the process is preempted and added to the end of the ready queue. Round Robin provides fair CPU allocation and good response time but may have higher turnaround time and context switching overhead.

Performance metrics for evaluating these algorithms include waiting time, turnaround time, response time, throughput, and CPU utilization.
