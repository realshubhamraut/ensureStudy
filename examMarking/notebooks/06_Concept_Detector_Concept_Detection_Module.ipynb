    "# Concept Detection Module - Detailed Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifies academic concepts in student answers using knowledge base mapping.\n",
    "Tracks which concepts are covered, partially covered, or missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Module Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why concept-based evaluation:**\n",
    "- Ensures comprehensive answers\n",
    "- Detects critical vs non-critical concept gaps\n",
    "- Maps student understanding to curriculum topics\n",
    "- Enables targeted feedback on what to study\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge Base Structure:**\n",
    "- Concepts → Keywords mapping\n",
    "- Concept weights (importance)\n",
    "- Critical concept flags\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detection Logic:**\n",
    "- 70% keyword threshold for concept detection\n",
    "- Partial detection (20-70% keywords found)\n",
    "- Missing (<20% keywords)\n",
    "- Penalty for missing critical concepts (e.g., 20% deduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Concept \"BST Deletion\" requires keywords: deletion, remove, successor, predecessor\n"
